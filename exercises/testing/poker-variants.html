    <p>While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games.</p>
   </div>

<div><h3>Here are a few intriguing variants to consider: </h3></div>
<div class="list">
    <p>
        <strong>1. Omaha Hold'em:</strong> Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players
        receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form
        their hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Seven Card Stud:</strong> Players receive seven cards, and the
        goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card
        dealt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Five Card Draw:</strong> Each player is dealt five private
        cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an
        attempt to improve their hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Razz:</strong> A lowball variant where the goal is to have the
        lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple:</strong> Variants of Hold'em
        where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card
        must be discarded after the flop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Stud High-Low:</strong> A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud
        where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.
      </p>
