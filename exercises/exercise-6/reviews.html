<p><b>Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times:</b> "Charade" is a gem of a movie, a delightful blend of suspense and humor, carried by the irresistible charm of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Stanley Donen's direction creates an atmosphere of constant intrigue and witty banter that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It's a classic for all the right reasons.</p>
    <p><b>The New York Times:</b> "Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant make an enchanting pair in 'Charade.' The film's plot is a rollercoaster of twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nothing short of electric. It's a sophisticated and timeless thriller with a touch of romance that remains a cinematic treasure."</p>
<p><b>Variety:</b> "'Charade' is a masterclass in the art of blending genres. The movie seamlessly switches between suspense and comedy, and it does so with style. Hepburn and Grant are at the top of their game, and the supporting cast adds depth to the story. It's a classic that has stood the test of time."</p>
        <p><b>Empire Magazine:</b> "Stanley Donen's 'Charade' is a prime example of cinematic craftsmanship. With its Hitchcockian suspense and Hitchcockian wit, it's a film that keeps you guessing until the very end. The Parisian backdrop and the unforgettable duo of Hepburn and Grant make it an absolute must-watch."</p>
                <p><b>The Guardian:</b> "Charade" is the kind of film that transports you to a different era of cinema. It's a stylish and thrilling journey through 1960s Paris, guided by the luminous Audrey Hepburn and the ever-charming Cary Grant. The combination of suspense and romance makes it a true classic."</p>
